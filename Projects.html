			<h2>Astrophysics thesis</h2><br>
			<p><b>Milky Way Structure</b><br>
			For the purposes of this model, the galaxy has been split into four components - the thin disk, thick
			disk, halo, and bulge.<br>The galactic bulge is the most densely populated region of the galaxy, and contains mostly
			older stars.<br>We decided on a bar angle of 29.4 degrees from our line of sight, as established by Cao
			et al. (2013) [4], with kinematics as established by Bovy et al. (2019) [5].<br>
			The thin and thick disk of the Milky Way are distinct both chemically and kinematically, with
			the thick disk being older than the thin disk.<br>The formation history of theses disks is unclear -
			competing theories suggest either that the two disks were formed separately,<br>or that the thick disk
			is the result of stellar migration and/or flaring of stars previously located in the thin disk.<br> Regardless, the distinctions between them make it necessary for them to be considered separately for this
			model [6].
			Lastly,<br> the galactic halo is a very low density region and extends out to several hundred kiloparsecs. The stars in this part of the galaxy are remnants from dwarf galaxies that collided with the
			Milky Way.<br> While there is some evidence to suggest that the halo may actually be divided into an
			inner halo and an outer halo,<br> with slight differences in kinematics, for the purposes of this model
			we will be considering the stellar halo as one structure [7].</p><br>
